However, if you need to detect objects not covered by the provided models, you can customize any of the provided models with your own data and MediaPipe Model Maker.

        "Retraining a model for object detection requires a dataset that includes the items, or classes, that you want the completed model to be able to identify. You can do this by trimming down a public dataset to only the classes that are relevant to your usecase, compiling your own dataset, or some combination of both, The dataset can be significantly smaller than what would be required to train a new model. For example, the [COCO](https://cocodataset.org/) dataset used to train many reference models contains hundreds of thousands of images with 91 classes of objects. Transfer learning with Model Maker can retrain an existing model with a smaller dataset and still perform well, depending on your inference accuracy goals.

This approach reduces the size of the data processed by the model, for example by transforming 32-bit floating point numbers to 8-bit integers. This technique is widely used to further optimize models after the training process.\n",

To optimize model performance, experiment with different model and retraining parameters in order to obtain the highest test accuracy. Refer to the [Retraining parameters](#retraining_parameters) section for more information on customizing these settings.\n",

The ImageNet dataset is more complex, with over a million training images and 1000 classes, while the flowers dataset has only 3670 training images and 5 classses.\n",
